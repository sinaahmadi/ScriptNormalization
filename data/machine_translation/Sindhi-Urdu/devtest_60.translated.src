Outside the savannah, humans have a digestive system that makes it difficult for them to replenish their amino acid levels from the sources available in the buds.
However, the consequences of failure are: sickness, death, and finally death.
There will be far more accessible sources of potatoes than sod that can be accessed in fields and forests, but we have difficulty digesting the seeds for primates until they are cooked.
On the other hand, the animal's digestive tract (frogs, mammals, eggs) not only digests easily, but also produces large amounts of protein, which contains hundreds of essential amino acids.
Consider all these things, and do not be surprised if we, like our forefathers, resolve our "spring problem" in the same way that the Savannah champions did.
